# Algorithms & Data Structures

I created this project to practice and share my Algorithm and Data Structures Implementations. Most Algorithms are based on the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book. However, I have also implemented a couple of helpful functions to generate trees and graphs, etc. to help test the algorithms.

I've tried to use good practices to keep the code as structured as possible in order for it to make sense when using the classes and functions. Also this will help to avoid misuse or confusions when trying to use the algorithms.

## Contents:
### Main.java
Shows how to use the Classes and Functions Implemented.

### TreesPractice.java
Implementation of:
- Tree:
-- generateBinaryTree(depth)
-- preOrderTraverse(root)
-- binarySearch(root, value)

- Tree Node:
-- visit()

### GraphPractice.java
Implementation of:
- Graph:
-- depthFirstSearch(root);
--breathFirstSearch(root);

- GraphNode

### HashMapsPractice.java
- HashMap:
-- populateHashMap()

### SortingPractice.java
- Merge Sort:
-- mergeSort(array)

- Quick Sort:
-- quickSort(array)

### StringManipulation.java
- StringManipulation:
-- traverseChars()
-- isPalindrome(string)
